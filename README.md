# Network Analysis for Characterizing Yield-reducing and Yield-limiting Factors from Farmers' Field Survey across South and South East Asia. 

# Network Analysis of SKEP survey phase 1 data

This project used for analysis the survey data which is from the SKEP project in Phase 1. 
The structure of this project

```
proj/
|-----R/
|-----data/
|-----figs/
|-----function/
|-----function/
|-----output/
```
- The ``` R ```  folder will contain the Rscript 
- The ``` data ``` directory contain the file which used for the analysis
- The ``` fig ``` directory contain the graph, fig, etc. which are the products from the rscript only
- The ``` function ``` directory contains the functions 
- The ``` output ``` directory contains the output which are the products from Rscripts, the products will be saved as the RData.  file.

The ideas are behind this research

1 I would constuct the **corelation based network**
2 Another netwotk that I would build is **regression based network**. This model can show the dynamic of relationships quantitativly such as if variable A changed how then other variables  will change
